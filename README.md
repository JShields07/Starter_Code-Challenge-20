Module 20 Challenge Work

The Challenge requires:

Create a JSA Contract in Solidity
Compiling and deploy your contract in the Remix IDE - Mainnet Fork VM
Utilizing the deployed smart contract


## Programming languages
Solidity is used to deploy a smart contract and communicate transactions on the blockchain

## How to use
Deploy the file on a test network and make a transaction between two contracts

## Notice to the graders
Metamask failed to connect to Ganache even after multiple tries. Could not figure out how to get it to reconnect, I apologize for the lack of gifs of completed work. Inital testing did seem to work, but I am having trouble getting the transactions to complete.
